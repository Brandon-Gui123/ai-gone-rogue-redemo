Packages used:
 * Tween by Digital Ruby (Jeff Johnson)         (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/tween-55983)
    - For performing transitions, such as changing a float variable from 0 to 1 in 0.5 seconds.
      The package didn't include support for transitions using unscaled time, but I modified it
      and now it accepts unscaled time.
